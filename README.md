<h3>Question 1 details</h3>
<p>Question 1 is done by using jQuery technology. The user enters their username and password which then generates a token that is sent to the given JSON API. It is not in the working condition. There are still some errors in sending the data to the given API.</p>
<h3>Question 2 details</h3>
<p>The TODO List that i made is a client side rendered one. The technologies used in creating this TODO List are Node, Express, and EJS. There is also some styling added. You can add tasks in this TODO list. Then, if you have done the task, you click on the checkbox and then you can see that that specific task is now in a strikethrough form. I am still in progress in creating a functionality so that whenever you click on the checkbox, the task gets totally removed from the page.</p>
